# Python-Challenge


2021 - Data Analytics Bootcamp


      Here are some concepts that were covered in this Python Project:

      a. Assigning variables in Python
  
  
      b. Opening and reading csv file from directory
  
  
      c. Looping through the dataset to return desired results
  
  
      d. Creating dictionaries and accessing keys as a list when necessary to store additional values to call upon later on
  
  
      e. Printing data in desired formats 
  
  
      f. Creating summary data as output
  
  
      g. Exporting output elements to a text file from local directory
      
      
      i. Pushing commits to github repo on a regular basis and vice versa (from local environment)
      
      
      j. Creating folders and files to use in directory

    PyBank Project:
    
    In this project, a budget dataset in csv format was opened and read from a local directory. The csv file was parsed through to access information and calculate several things such as:
    
    a. The total number of months included in the dataset

    b. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    c. Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

    d. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

     e. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
   
    Lastly, a summary of the results was exported to a text file that is available in the Analysis folder.

    PyPoll Project:
    
    In this project, an election dataset in csv format was opened and read from a local directory. The csv file was parsed through to access information and calculate several things such as:
    

      a. A complete list of candidates who received votes

      b. The percentage of votes each candidate won

      c. The total number of votes each candidate won

      d. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
 
    Lastly, a summary of the results was exported to a text file that is available in the Analysis folder.
