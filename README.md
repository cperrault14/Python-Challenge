    PyBank Project:
    
    In this project, an election dataset in csv format was opened and read from a local directory. The csv file was parsed through to access information and calculate several things such as:
    
    a. The total number of months included in the dataset

    b. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    c. Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

    d. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

     e. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
   
    Lastly, a summary of the results was exported to a text file that is available in the Analysis folder.
